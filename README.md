# FemAlert: AI-Powered Women Safety Analytics System
## Introduction
FemALert is an advanced real-time threat detection system designed to enhance women's safety using AI-driven analytics. It leverages computer vision, machine learning, and real-time alert mechanisms to identify potential threats and suspicious activities.

## Features
 Real-Time Anomaly Detection â€“ Identifies unusual behavior to alert authorities.
ðŸ”¹ **Person Detection & Gender Classification** â€“ Counts and classifies individuals in an area.

ðŸ”¹ **Lone Woman Detection at Night** â€“ Detects women walking alone in unsafe conditions.

ðŸ”¹ **Surrounding Threat Analysis** â€“ Identifies when a woman is surrounded by a group of men.

ðŸ”¹ **Gesture-Based SOS Recognition** â€“ Recognizes emergency signals like hand gestures for distress.

## Tech Stack
**Machine Learning & Computer Vision**

**Object & Person Detection**:
YOLOv8 (Real-time person detection, gender classification)

**Gesture Recognition & SOS Detection**:
OpenPose (Pose estimation for distress gestures)
MediaPipe (Lightweight alternative for hand/face keypoint detection)

**Frameworks**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV

## How It Works
-Real-time video feed processing through an AI-powered surveillance system.

-Threat detection & anomaly analysis using trained ML models.
